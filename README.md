# AI Engineer Development Roadmap (2026)

A practical, opinionated roadmap for experienced software engineers positioning themselves as AI Engineers — whether targeting full-time roles ($150K–$300K+) or independent consulting ($150–250/hr).

## What This Is

This isn't a generic "learn AI" guide aimed at beginners. It's a structured plan for engineers who already know how to ship software and want to formalize their AI engineering skills with the right courses, certifications, frameworks, and portfolio projects.

The roadmap covers:

- **Foundations** — Courses on RAG, agentic AI, and multi-agent systems (with specific recommendations)
- **Cloud Certifications** — Parallel tracks for Azure-focused and AWS-focused engineers, including the new AWS Generative AI Developer Professional certification
- **Framework & Tooling Depth** — The production stack that matters: LangChain, LangGraph, vector databases, evaluation frameworks, and deployment tooling
- **Portfolio Projects** — Six detailed project specifications designed to demonstrate real-world AI engineering skills, not tutorial clones
- **Differentiation** — How to stand out when everyone is adding "AI" to their LinkedIn title

## Who This Is For

- Senior software engineers exploring AI engineering roles
- Solutions architects adding AI to their practice
- Developers at startups building AI features who want to formalize their skills
- Engineers considering independent AI consulting

## Key Principles

1. **Build, don't just study.** Courses teach patterns. Projects prove you can ship.
2. **The LLM is 20% of the system.** The other 80% is engineering — data pipelines, cost management, evaluation, deployment, and making outputs useful to real users.
3. **Focus on the 80/20.** RAG, prompt engineering, API integration, evaluation, and production deployment are where the jobs and revenue live. Skip the PhD-level research.
4. **Portfolio over credentials.** Certifications open doors. A portfolio of shipped, production-grade AI systems closes deals.

## Quick Start

Read [`ai-engineer-roadmap.md`](ai-engineer-roadmap.md) — it's the complete plan.

## Updates

This roadmap reflects the AI engineering landscape as of **February 2026**. The field moves fast — certifications launch, frameworks evolve, and best practices shift. I plan to update this periodically as things change.
